# Network Location Switcher

This is a boredom project...

At work, it's BYOD. But there's a tonne of network configurations on company
network, so it's been annoying to have to manually enable/disable the configs at
and outside of work.

I also do not know Swift and I'm just learning, what better way than to start with
a minor project.

## Ooooh, what does this button do?
Well, the goal is to build an app that listens for network changes and automatically
switches configs and profiles.

For starters, I'll just try to switch already stored Network Locations based on
network changes and see how it goes from there.
